Overview:
    This is library for  state-space models interpolation. These routines are intended
    for small size state-space models (ROMs), hence some methods may not be optimised
    to exploit sparsity structures. For generality purposes, all methods require in
    input interpolatory weights


The module includes the methods:
    - transfer_function: returns an interpolatory state-space model based on the
    transfer function method [1]. This method is general and is, effectively, a
    wrapper of the libss.join method.
    - BT_transfer_function: evolution of transfer function methods. The growth of
    the interpolated system size is avoided through balancing.
