SHARPy is an aeroelastic analysis package developed by the Load Control and Aeroelasticty lab at Imperial College. The tool is capable of running nonlinear, time-domain and static coupled simulations of high-aspect ratio wings, including very flexible aircraft and wind turbines. It is based on a geometrically exact, displacement and rotation based nonlinear beam theory coupled with an unsteady vortex lattice method solver (UVLM) for the aerodynamics.
